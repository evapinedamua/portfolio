Hi my loves, 
It's prom season, so what better excuse is there to use glitter and pigments!? 
I'm normally one for more classic and 'samey' makeup, even when it comes to an event; but I thought I'd create a bolder look for those of you who are a lot less boring than me! Haha. 
I will be uploading a natural alternative involving more affordable products, so stay tuned!

Enjoy! x.
