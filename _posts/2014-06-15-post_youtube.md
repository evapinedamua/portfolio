You can never go wrong with a timeless make-up look, and this is my go-to look for any special occasion or skip the false lashes for an easy office-night-out transition! It's so easy to apply, flattering and looks good on everyone. This is my technique on how I apply winged liner, and immaculate red lipstick that lasts the long-haul.
